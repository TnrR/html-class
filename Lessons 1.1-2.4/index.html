<!---Please note, this index.html file consists of the past lessons combined 
I figured rather than making a new file everytime, it'd just be easier to build 
upon it when the lessons overlapped (so far, hands on: 1.1-2.4) 

For future reference, I'll also be continually maintaining these files on 
Github, so that that they may freely downloaded and all in one place.

        Heading tags can help your pages be more accessible and usable. It is coding practice to outline the
